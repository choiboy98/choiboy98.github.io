    Last semester, I was on the 
    <a href = "https://uiuc.hack4impact.org/projects/?name=c2tc-2" target = "_blank">Cut to the Case team</a>
    , where we developed a mobile application to improve the safety of all students on campus. It is a map based application which shows public safety details such as crime details, streetlights, open businesses, and many more filters.

    This semester, I am on the Kiva team, where we develop an interactive webpage for people who are trying to transfer important documents. I will be using Postgres and Box API to focus on the backend and the security aspect of the project.
