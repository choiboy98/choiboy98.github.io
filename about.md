<h2>Academics<h2>

<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 300">I am studying Computer Science at the 
	<a href = "https://cs.illinois.edu" target = "_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</a>
	Currently, I am interested in Computer Security and Artificial Intelligence. I am juggling between 17 credit hours, 2 committed club activities, and an internship.
</p>

<h2>Organization</h2>

<p>I am passionate about using technology to give back to the community. Therefore, I am currently working as a software developer for 
	<a href = "https://uiuc.hack4impact.org/" target = "_blank">Hack4Impact</a>
	, where I work to develop softwares for non-profit organizations. These projects include 
	<a href = "https://uiuc.hack4impact.org/projects/?name=c2tc-2" target = "_blank">Cut to the Case</a> 
	in which I worked as a Frontend developer and 
	<a href = "https://www.kiva.org" target = "_blank">Kiva</a>
	in which I am working as a Backend and a Security developer.
</p>

<p>I am also passionate about sports. I have been boxing for over a year now and have been part of the 
	<a href = "http://illiniboxing.com" target = "_blank">UIUC Boxing Competitive team</a> 
	for 2 semesters now. I will be competing at 
	<a href = "https://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/sports-and-events/boxing-MMA/amateur-boxing" target = "_blank">Arnold Classic</a>
	and 
	<a href = "http://www.collegeboxing.org/nationals/" target = "_blank">USIBA Nationals</a>.
	Boxing has taught me teamwork, perseverance, and confidence.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>I have always loved to cook. Inspired by Jimmy Wong and his pop-up restaurant,
	<a href = "http://www.denchrestaurant.com" target = "_blank">DENCH.</a>,
	I am seriously beginning my cooking journey as an aspiring chef. I am putting up some pictures of my creation on 
	<a href = "http://www.choidaniel.info/dan-dy/" target = "_blank">DAN-DY.</a>
</p>

<p>Along with cooking, I love singing. I create covers and my own songs occasionally. Some of my videos can be found on
	<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/MrChoicode" target = "_blank">MusiChoi</a> and
	<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnJWZXnbLkhQvWDPItFUTDg" target = "_blank">story of us</a>.
